## ðŸŒŸ Reflection: Creating My CV

**Situation:**  
As part of the Work Readiness Training (PRP370S), we were required to create and submit a professional CV that highlights our academic background, skills, and experience.

**Task:**  
My goal was to develop a well-structured CV that effectively communicates my qualifications and technical capabilities to potential employers.

**Action:**  
I gathered details about my education, skills, and academic projects. I formatted this information clearly using Markdown for the GitHub portfolio and also prepared a PDF version to include in the `assets` folder. I ensured the CV reflected both my technical skills and soft skills.

**Result:**  
I successfully created a clean, professional CV in both PDF and Markdown formats. The Markdown version improves online visibility and version control through GitHub, and the PDF version is ready for formal applications.
