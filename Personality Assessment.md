## âœ… Evidence

As part of the Work Readiness Training, I completed a personality assessment to better understand how my personal traits influence my work style and team interactions.

The assessment provided insights into:
- My approach to problem-solving and decision-making
- How I respond to feedback and manage stress
- My strengths in team collaboration and communication

It also gave me useful tips on career environments where I could thrive based on my personality type.
