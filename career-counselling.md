# Career Counselling

---

## âœ… Evidence

As part of the Work Readiness Training, I participated in career counselling sessions offered through the university. These sessions helped me:

- Explore possible ICT-related career paths
- Learn how to research job roles and required qualifications
- Gain insight into interview expectations and job market trends
- Define short- and long-term career goals

I also engaged in self-assessment activities that helped me understand which roles match my interests and skills.
