## âœ… Evidence

As part of the Work Readiness Training, I completed a skills audit and interest profiler. These activities helped me:

- Identify my strengths in programming, web development, and database management
- Recognize interests in software development, problem-solving, and creative tech projects
- Understand which career paths align with my natural interests and technical competencies

In addition, I reflected on past academic and personal projects to identify skills such as teamwork, time management, and communication.

## ðŸŒŸ Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
We were required to evaluate our personal skills and career interests during the Work Readiness Training module.

**Task:**  
The goal was to recognize my strengths and preferences in order to match them to appropriate career paths and learning goals.

**Action:**  
I completed a structured skills audit and used an interest profiler tool provided during the training. I also reviewed feedback from past group projects and lecturers to assess areas where I consistently performed well.

**Result:**  
I discovered that I enjoy back-end development, logic-driven tasks, and data handling. These findings helped me target roles such as software engineer and system analyst, and guided the focus of my CV and project portfolio.
